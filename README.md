# emojiverse
A FB Messenger Bot that takes in an image, and replaces all the faces in the image with an emoji of the same expression! 

Message 'Emojiverse' on Facebook Messenger to try it out! Or visit the page at https://www.facebook.com/emojiverse/

The idea for Emojiverse was born at HackHarvard 2016 by Ryan Lim, John Amadeo (me), Brian Kitano, and Jack Roth!
The project was initially an Android app, but after the hackathon I decided to repackage the project as a bot. I wanted to learn how to set one up, and thought using a FB messenger bot would be a good interaction model since it would be easier for users it they could try it without having to download anything.

The file ```get_emoji.py```, the app icon and the loading icon was created by Brian Kitano, and Ryan Lim contributed to ```face_labeler.py```. All other code was written by myself.
